## Adam Erickson

In this repository you will find the two components of the application:

- **backend**: python flask backend server as well as database
  - also contains code for cleaning and constructing database
  - and retrieving data from APIs
  - run the api server with `source myvenv/bin/activate; python models.py`
- **frontend**:
  - created in React.js
  - To **consume** the **API** provided by the backend
  - note that it is not static files, but **also contains a server**, run it with `npm start` after properly configuring your `npm` and `node.js` builds

And there is also further information in the **backend** repo on the source of the government data.
